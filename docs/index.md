# Welcome to Docker Service Example

## Overview

This is an overview of my service; I wrote this service to fullfill a use-case as requested by a stakeholder.  It performs these duties, allowing end users to perform their job function.  It currently runs as a service on some infrastructure.  Please let me know at my-email-address if you require any support.

## Architecture

This service is composed of several micro-services.  Each micro-service uses industry standards so that I, as an Engineer can spend more time working with stakeholders to help them achieve their true purpose instead of spending time re-implementing certain services, features, etc.

These services currently consist of:

* nginx
* django

As these services are industry standards, there are large teams that support them.  This means that I do not need to do that, and can instead _make_ those said services useful.

_todo_: add diagram

## Support

Please file a support ticket if you require any new features, encounter any issues, or would like to say hi.
